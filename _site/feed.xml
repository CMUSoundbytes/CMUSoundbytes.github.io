				<title>Almost Midnight A Cappella Fall '16</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We are always happy to host AMAC, and provide campus with a well deserved break from finals. It was a great time showcasing lots of our arrangements, new and old, getting some almost midnight breakfast, taking our classic elevator selfie and hosting all of our friends in our campus a cappella groups. We wish everyone a safe and restful winter break and can‚Äôt wait for all of the exciting things happening in the spring semester! &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Bhangra in the Burgh</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;We had the amazing opportunity to perform as an exhibition act for Bhangra in the Burgh 2016! Bhangra in the Burgh is a platform for top Bhangra (Indian folk dance) teams from across the nation to showcase their talent in a colorful exhibition of the energy and excitement that Bhangra represents. It is one of the largest student-run events in Pittsburgh and never fails to raise a great deal of money for charity, and we are so grateful to have been a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Our first performance of the semester (and the first performance with NewBytes!) was at Acapittsburgh 2016, CMU Counterpoints annual Charity Concert. The theme of the year was Music as a Universal Language. It always is an incredible experience to perform with all of Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs a cappella groups, we had a great time being the first group up and sharing the stage with everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
