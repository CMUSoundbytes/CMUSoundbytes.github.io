We are always happy to host AMAC, and provide campus with a well deserved break from finals. It was a great time showcasing lots of our arrangements, new and old, getting some almost midnight breakfast, taking our classic elevator selfie and hosting all of our friends in our campus a cappella groups. We wish everyone a safe and restful winter break and canâ€™t wait for all of the exciting things happening in the spring semester! <3
