Some of our group members got the chance to sing with Billy Porter, CMU alum and original Broadway cast member of the show Kinky Boots! Individuals from all of our campus a cappella groups came together to perform “Fight Song”, by Rachel Platten with Billy for an event held by individuals involved in the Clinton-Kane Campaign.
