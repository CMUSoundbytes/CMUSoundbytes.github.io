Today, Soundbytes had the amazing privilege to perform at the campaign event for Hillary Clinton held at Carnegie Mellon University. We are incredibly grateful to everyone involved and honored to have had the opportunity to reach so many people with our music. Soundbytes would like to emphasize that our participation in this event does not reflect a group-wide endorsement for any candidate. However, we strongly encourage you to become informed on everyone's stances on the issues and to vote for the candidate you agree with the most. Thank you to CMU Student Activities and the campaign for giving us this unique opportunity!
