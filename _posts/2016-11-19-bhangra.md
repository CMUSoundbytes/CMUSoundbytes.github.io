We had the amazing opportunity to perform as an exhibition act for Bhangra in the Burgh 2016! Bhangra in the Burgh is a platform for top Bhangra (Indian folk dance) teams from across the nation to showcase their talent in a colorful exhibition of the energy and excitement that Bhangra represents. It is one of the largest student-run events in Pittsburgh and never fails to raise a great deal of money for charity, and we are so grateful to have been a part of it. 

As always, it is always a great time performing for such an amazing audience, and it was our first time breaking out our favorite wine, black & gold color pallette. We got some great shots of us lookinâ€™ pretty classy, if we do say so ourselves.
